// Problem 1 04-28-2025 : 1400 PST
//  POSITIONING ASYNC FETCH 
  // putting event listeners inside the fetch, would now just fetch the default value of the select element instead of whatever the user chooses
  // how do I acknowledge the change to original and foreign currency select without making two fetches inside the event listener? Does that mean I have to perform both event listeners before doing the fetches?
