// Problem 1 04-28-2025
//  POSITIONING ASYNC FETCH 
  // putting event listeners inside the fetch, would now just fetch the default value of the select element instead of whatever the user chooses
  // how do I acknowledge the change to original and foreign currency select and amount input  without making too many fetches inside event listenerrs? Does that mean I have to write event listeners before doing one fetch only?
