// CHAINING SYNTAX

// const step1 = () => {
//     return new Promise((resolve) => {
//         setTimeout(() => {
//             console.log("Step 1: Data fetched");
//             resolve("Data from Step 1");
//         }, 1000);
//     });
// };

// const step2 = (previousData) => {
//     return new Promise((resolve) => {
//         setTimeout(() => {
//             console.log(`Step 2: Processing ${previousData}`);
//             resolve("Data from Step 2");
//         }, 1000);
//     });
// };

// const step3 = (previousData) => {
//     return new Promise((resolve) => {
//         setTimeout(() => {
//             console.log(`Step 3: Finalizing with ${previousData}`);
//             resolve("Data from Step 3");
//         }, 1000);
//     });
// };

// // Chaining promises
// step1()
//     .then((result1) => step2(result1))
//     .then((result2) => step3(result2))
//     .then((finalResult) => console.log("Final Output:", finalResult))
//     .catch((error) => console.log("Error:", error));




// Exercise 1: Chaining Math Operations
// Create three functions:
// doubleNumber(num): Doubles a number after 1 second.
// squareNumber(num): Squares the number after 1 second.
// subtractFive(num): Subtracts 5 after 1 second.
// ðŸ‘‰ Chain these functions to:
// Start with 5.
// Double it â†’ Square the result â†’ Subtract 5.
// Log the final output.



// Exercise 2: Simulating an Order Processing System
// Create three functions that return Promises:
// placeOrder(order): Resolves in 2 seconds with "Order placed: <order>".
// processPayment(order): Resolves in 1.5 seconds with "Payment successful for: <order>".
// shipOrder(order): Resolves in 1 second with "Order shipped: <order>".
// ðŸ‘‰ Chain these functions to simulate the process for an order:
// Place an order for "Laptop".
// Process the payment.
// Ship the order.
// Log the final shipping confirmation.


// Exercise 3: Handling Errors in a Chain
// Modify Exercise 2, but now make processPayment() fail randomly 50% of the time (reject with "Payment failed").
// ðŸ‘‰ If it fails, catch the error and log: "Order failed: Payment could not be processed".


// Exercise 4: Simulating a User Login System
// Create three functions that return Promises:
// validateUser(username): Resolves in 1 second if the username is "admin", otherwise rejects with "Invalid user".
// fetchUserData(username): Resolves in 1.5 seconds with "User data for: <username>".
// showDashboard(data): Resolves in 1 second with "Welcome to the dashboard: <data>".
// ðŸ‘‰ Chain them to:
// Validate the username "admin".
// Fetch user data.
// Show the dashboard.
// Log the final message.
// Handle errors (e.g., if the username isnâ€™t "admin", stop the chain).


// Exercise 5: Fetching Weather Data with Fake API
// Create three functions that return Promises:
// fetchCity(city): Resolves in 1 second with "Fetching weather for <city>".
// getTemperature(city): Resolves in 1.5 seconds with "Temperature in <city> is 25Â°C".
// suggestClothing(temp): Resolves in 1 second with "It's warm, wear light clothing".
// ðŸ‘‰ Chain them to:
// Start with "San Francisco".
// Fetch city data â†’ Get temperature â†’ Suggest clothing.
// Log the final clothing suggestion.


// Exercise 6: Movie Recommendation System
// Create functions that return Promises:
// getUserPreferences(userId): Resolves in 1 second with "User prefers Action movies".
// fetchRecommendedMovies(genre): Resolves in 1.5 seconds with "Recommended movies: Mad Max, John Wick".
// displayMovies(movies): Resolves in 1 second with "Here are your movies: <movies>".
// ðŸ‘‰ Chain them to:
// Get preferences for userId: 101.
// Fetch movie recommendations based on the userâ€™s preference.
// Display the movies.


// Exercise 7: Simulating an Online Quiz
// Create three functions that return Promises:
// startQuiz(): Resolves in 1 second with "Quiz started!".
// answerQuestion(): Resolves in 1.5 seconds with "Correct answer!" or 50% of the time fails with "Wrong answer!".
// showResults(): Resolves in 1 second with "You completed the quiz!".
// ðŸ‘‰ Chain them to:
// Start the quiz.
// Answer the question.
// Show results only if the answer is correct.
// If the answer is wrong, stop the chain and log "Try again!".

// Exercise 8: Chaining API Calls (Fake Data)
// Create three functions that return Promises:
// fetchUserID(username): Resolves in 1 second with "User ID for <username> is 456".
// fetchUserPosts(userID): Resolves in 1.5 seconds with "Posts by user <userID>: ['Post 1', 'Post 2']".
// displayPosts(posts): Resolves in 1 second with "Showing posts: <posts>".
// ðŸ‘‰ Chain them to:
// Start with "johndoe".
// Get the user ID â†’ Fetch their posts â†’ Display the posts.
// Handle errors (e.g., if the user isnâ€™t found, stop the chain).


// Exercise 9: Simulating a Banking System
// Create three functions that return Promises:
// checkBalance(accountNumber): Resolves in 1 second with "Balance: $500", but 50% of the time fails with "Insufficient funds".
// withdrawAmount(amount): Resolves in 1.5 seconds with "Withdrew $100, remaining balance: $400".
// confirmTransaction(): Resolves in 1 second with "Transaction successful!".
// ðŸ‘‰ Chain them to:
// Check balance for account "123456".
// Withdraw $100.
// Confirm the transaction.
// If funds are insufficient, stop the chain and log "Transaction failed!".


// Exercise 10: Booking a Flight
// Create three functions that return Promises:
// searchFlights(from, to): Resolves in 1.5 seconds with "Flights found from <from> to <to>".
// selectFlight(flightId): Resolves in 1 second with "Flight <flightId> selected".
// confirmBooking(): Resolves in 1 second with "Booking confirmed!".
// ðŸ‘‰ Chain them to:
// Search for flights from "New York" to "Los Angeles".
// Select flight ID 9876.
// Confirm the booking.
